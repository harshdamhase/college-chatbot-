# College Chatbot using Python

This is a College Chatbot project implemented using Python programming language. The purpose of this chatbot is to provide assistance to students who have various queries related to their college courses, exams, assignments, and other related topics.

The chatbot fetches data from a JSON file and uses it to respond to user queries.

## Installation

Before running the code, you need to make sure that you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them by running the following command:

```
pip install flask

```

This will install the Flask web framework, which is required to run the application.

You also need to make sure that the `data.json` file exists in the same directory as the `app.py` file, and that it contains the data that the chatbot will use to respond to user queries.

Once you have installed the dependencies and made sure that the `data.json` file is present, you can run the `app.py` file using the following command:

```
python app.py

```

This will start the Flask development server, and you can access the chatbot by visiting `http://localhost:5000/` in your web browser.

## Usage

To use this chatbot, type a message in the input field and hit the `Send` button. The chatbot will fetch data from the `data.json` file and use it to respond to your query.

If the chatbot is unable to understand your query, it will suggest some possible queries that you can try. You can click on any of these suggestions to get a response from the chatbot.
